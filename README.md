# What is RFM?

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) is a marketing analysis technique that segments customers based on their recent purchase activity, the frequency of their purchases, and the monetary value of those purchases. It helps businesses identify and target different customer segments for more effective marketing strategies.
